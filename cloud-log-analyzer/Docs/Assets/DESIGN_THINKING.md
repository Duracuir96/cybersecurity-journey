2. **User Testing**: Peer review of GitHub presentation
3. **Feature Enhancement**: Add advanced capabilities incrementally

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Complexity
Start simple, enhance gradually. Each iteration delivers value.

### 2. User-Centric Documentation
Assume zero context. Make everything self-explanatory.

### 3. Cloud-Native Mindset
Leverage cloud services appropriately while maintaining cost control.

### 4. Portfolio-First Thinking
Every feature should be showcaseable and explainable.
