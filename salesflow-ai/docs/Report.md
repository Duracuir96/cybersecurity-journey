# Python/Data & DevSecOps Engineer — SalesFlow Lite
### Microservices • Security by Design • Automation • Analytics & ML (FastAPI + Spring Boot)

---

## 1) Authentic introduction (problem, collaboration, my role)

**Business problem:**  
Small businesses often operate with basic POS workflows but lack **sales visibility**, **analytics**, and **decision-support** (forecasting + anomaly detection). SalesFlow Lite addresses this gap by adding analytics/reporting/ML as a dedicated service layer.

**Collaboration note (transparent):**  
- **Java/Spring Boot backend** (core business logic + auth) was implemented with a partner.  
- **React frontend** was shared.  
- **My central ownership:** the **Python/FastAPI microservice** (Data + Automation + Security integration) and the **Ops-ready architecture choices** for a local-production MVP. 

---

## 2) Contributions — 4 pillars

---

## 🔹 Pillar A — Data & Machine Learning

### What I built
- **FastAPI analytics + ML APIs** under `/api/v1/*` (analytics, ml, excel, reports).   
- **Pandas-based processing**: normalization, aggregation, time-series preparation (KPIs, daily totals, trend computation).   
- **Forecasting (decision support)** with fallback logic:
  - Linear Regression (default)
- **Anomaly detection**:
  - Z-score (simple + effective)
  - Severity labeling + human-readable explanations. 

### Concrete examples (from session reports)
- Forecast endpoint provides **trend** (`upward|downward|stable`) and summary KPIs (`total`, `daily_average`, `peak_value`, `peak_day`).   
- Z-score anomalies: `abs(z) >= 2` with severity **medium (2–3)** and **high (>=3)** plus labels like `ZERO_DROP`, `HIGH_SPIKE`, `VARIANCE_SHIFT`.   
- Fallback rules: if too few samples, fallback to z-score; if variance is zero, no z-score anomalies generated.   

---

## 🔹 Pillar B — Cybersecurity & DevSecOps (Security by Design)

### What I implemented (and why)
- **Unified JWT model across microservices**: Java issues tokens; Python extracts/validates/forwards the token when calling Java APIs (secure microservice communication).   
- **Strict Pydantic validation** to reduce malformed inputs and data abuse:
  - Literal enums for controlled values
  - Date regex + validation (end_date >= start_date)
  - Numeric constraints (e.g., stock fields `ge=0`).   
- **DEV vs PROD security behavior** documented and implemented:
  - DEV_MODE can bypass auth for development
  - PROD requires Bearer token validation via `jwt_validator.validate(token)`.   
- **Swagger/OpenAPI hardening**:
  - BearerAuth scheme applied to routes
  - Swagger locked with a dedicated dependency (`swagger_auth`).   
- **Resilience & safe failure**:
  - `raise_for_status()` on Java calls
  - mapped errors (401/403/503)
  - global exception handlers. 

**Security posture (sincere):**  
This MVP is “local production”, but security boundaries are real: auth consistency, strict validation, and explicit environment separation.   

---

## 🔹 Pillar C — Cloud & Architecture

### Architecture (local-production MVP, cloud-ready mindset)
- **Microservices split:**
  - Java (core + auth)
  - Python (analytics/ML/reports/excel import)
  - React frontend
  - PostgreSQL + Redis.   

### Containerization (Docker)
Each component isolated in its container with explicit ports (example stack):  
- PostgreSQL: 5432  
- Redis: 6379  
- Java API: 8080  
- Python API: 8081  
- Frontend: 5174 → 80  

### Ops decisions (pragmatic)
- `.env` is **not committed** (JWT secrets, DB credentials, SMTP credentials, internal URLs). This is a **security decision**, not a weakness. 
- CI/CD intentionally **deferred** because the scope is a local-production MVP; planned for real production/cloud.

## 🔹 Pillar D — Automation Architecture (Classes & Pipelines)

> The Python backend of **SalesFlow Lite** is built around **multiple layers of automation**.
> Automation is not limited to scripts: it is implemented as **tasks, service automation,
> backend pipelines, scheduling, and ML-assisted detection**.

This section presents **all implemented automation types**, followed by the **pipelines they enable**.

---

## 🧠 Automation Classes — What Is Implemented

SalesFlow Lite includes **five complementary automation classes**:

1. **Task & Script Automation**  
2. **Tool & API Automation**

## 4) Code organization & documentation 

**Python backend structure (as documented):**
- `src/api/routes/*` (analytics, excel, ml, reports, health)
- `src/api/dependencies.py` (DEV/PROD auth: `get_current_user`)
- `src/clients/*` (Java API clients)
- `src/services/*` (analytics, ML, reporting logic)
- `src/data/*` (cache, preprocessing, file processing)
- `src/integration/jwt_validator.py` (PROD JWT validation)   

---

I built SalesFlow Lite as a **realistic microservices MVP** to demonstrate a hybrid profile:
- **Data engineering mindset** (pipelines, validation, caching, analytics KPIs)
- **Security-by-design** (JWT boundaries, strict validation, env separation)
- **Automation-first backend** (reports, scheduling, ETL-style flows)

This project reflects my trajectory toward a **Cloud Security / Data Engineering** role focused on deployable, measurable systems.
