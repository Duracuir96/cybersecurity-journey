# 🧪 **Practical Labs – Networking Fundamentals**

This section documents hands-on lab work designed to validate and demonstrate my understanding of **core networking concepts** within the context of **Cloud Security Data Engineering**.

---

##  **Objective**

Apply networking fundamentals to real-world scenarios involving cloud infrastructure, secure data pipelines, and hybrid connectivity.

---

##  **Lab Focus Areas**

- Network segmentation and security group configuration
- Connectivity troubleshooting across cloud and on-premise environments
- Traffic flow analysis and monitoring
- Implementation of secure hybrid networking patterns
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

---

##  **Applied Knowledge**

Each lab reinforces concepts from **CompTIA Network+** while integrating with tools and platforms relevant to **cloud engineering and security operations**.

---

##  **Purpose**

To bridge theoretical understanding with **practical execution**—demonstrating not only what I know, but what I can build, secure, and troubleshoot.
