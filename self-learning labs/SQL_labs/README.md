# SQL Mastery Track – Completed ✅

I have successfully completed a comprehensive **SQL Mastery Track**, covering:

- SQL fundamentals and advanced querying techniques
- Complex joins, subqueries, views, and indexing strategies
- Aggregate functions and analytical data processing
- Relational database design and data modeling
- Database security best practices and connectivity

This track provided a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical application — from writing optimized queries to understanding database architecture, protection mechanisms, and system integration.

##  Upcoming Labs

To demonstrate and apply this knowledge, I will be releasing a series of **hands-on labs and projects**, focusing on:

- SQL query optimization and performance tuning
- Real-world database design and normalization
- Implementation of database security controls (access control, encryption, injection prevention)
- Integration of SQL with backend applications (Python, Java)
- Practical use cases combining data engineering and security

These labs are intended to serve as both a technical portfolio and a learning resource for the community.

More details coming soon.
